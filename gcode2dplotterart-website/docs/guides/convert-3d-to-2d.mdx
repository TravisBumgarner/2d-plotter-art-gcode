# Convert your 3D Printer to a 2D Plotter

Lots of folks have converted their 3D printers to 2D plotters. If you search around on Google, you should be able to find adapter parts that you can print. For example, I made an adapter for the Creality Ender 5 printer.

If you find an adapter or make your own, [please share it here](https://github.com/TravisBumgarner/gcode2dplotterart/discussions/6) so I can add it to the list. 

**Available Adapters**

Note - I have not tested or used any of these personally, besides the one I made.

## Making your own adapter

Here are the instructions on how I made my own adapter.

First I looked at my 3D printer and tried to find a place where I could mount a 3D printed part. My Ender 5 had two screws that were well placed that I thought I could attach my part to. My design would involve unscrewing those two screws, aligning the holes on the 3D printed part with those screw holes, and then screw everything together.

It took me a few different tries and adjusting my measurements before I had a part that fit well. The first experiment made sure the screw holes were lined up correctly. The second experiment had a better placement for the screw holes. The third experiment made sure that everything fit nicely together. The fourth experiment tested the ability to grip a plotting device.

Eventually I figured everything out and was ready for plotting.
