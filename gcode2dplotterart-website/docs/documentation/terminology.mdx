# Terminology

Don't see a definition below? [Ask here](https://github.com/TravisBumgarner/gcode2dplotterart/discussions/4).

## Drawing instrument

Whatever you are using to create your artwork. This could be a pen, marker, paintbrush, whatever!

## Drawing surface

Whatever you are using your drawing instrument on, it could be paper, wood, whatever!

## Limit switch

On some plotting devices, there are switches along each axis. When your plotting device hits these switches, it'll stop moving. However, if your device does not have limit switches, it's possible that the print head can go beyond these limits. The sound is not pleasant as your motors grind and your print head slams into the wall.  

## Plotting device

Refers to whichever device you are using to plot G-Code instructions. This will either be a 3D printer or a 2D plotter.

## Print head

This is the point where your drawing device (pen, market, paint brush, etc.) is attached to your plotting device. When the print head is raised it is not in contact with whatever you're drawing on.
