# Universal G-Code Sender (UGS)

## What is UGS?

UGS is the go to software for interacting with your plotting device. It offers a bunch of helpful tools to get started and can be used to send G-Code instructions and G-Code files to your device. 

## UGS Features

Below are a collection of features referenced in other parts of the documentation including the setup in the next section. 

### Controller State

![Controller screenshot](/img/ugs/controllerstate.png)

The controller state contains various details about the plotting device. Of interest is the X position, `0.000` and the Y position, `10.000`. These coordinates will be used with the Jog Controller to figure out the coordinates of your plotting device. Additionally, for those with 3D Printers, the Z position will be used to define the print head's lowered and raised positions.

### Jog Controller

![Jog controller screenshot](/img/ugs/jogcontroller.png)

:::danger

Be careful in this section. Start with small movements of your plotting device. If your device does not have limit switches, be careful. 

:::

The jog controller lets you control your plotting device in real time. You can move your print head in the X and Y direction. If you're using a 3D printer, you can raise and lower the Z direction. The jog controller, in conjunction with the controller state, will be used to setup the gcode2dplotterart library. 

Click the `Millimeters` button to toggle between millimeters and inches. You can see the current units at the bottom of the screen next to `Step size`. It'll either say `mm` for millimeters or `"` for inches. 

### Toolbox

![Toolbox screenshot](/img/ugs/toolbox.png)

The toolbox contains several useful features.

- `Reset Zero` - This will set the print head's current position to X = 0, Y = 0. All future movements will be made relative to this position. 
- `Return to Zero` - This will return the print head to the position defined by `Reset Zero`

### Macros

![Macros screenshot](/img/ugs/macros.png)

Macros let you define custom G-Code commands. I have defined some custom macros `Raise Print Head` and `Lower Print Head`. You can right click on this section to create your own macros.

:::caution

These instructions are specific to 2d plotters. More detail on creating your own macros will be defined in the TODO

### Console

### Visualizer

The visualizer can be used to preview G-Code instructions before they are plotted. To use the visualizer, load a G-Code file into UGS. Then click the icon of the box with the shading on the top. This'll give a top down view of what's being plotted. It may not be a completely accurate representation of what you're plotting but it should give a rough preview.

## Setup

Navigate to the [UGS](https://winder.github.io/ugs_website/download/) download page to get the software for your operating system. 

### Connect your plotting device

![Connect screenshot](/img/ugs/connect.png)

1. Open UGS and connect your plotting device to your computer, most likely via USB.
2. Click the refresh button next to `Port`. 
3. From the `Port` drop down menu select your device. Once you've successfully connected your device, the `Connect or Disconnect` button will turn orange. 

**Finding your device**

Your device might be listed below, keep reading.

- Doesbot A4 - `cu.usbserial-110`, `cu-usbserial-10`

Device naming may not be intuitive. If your device is not listed above, an easy way to figure out which device is the plotter is to select a device from the drop down menu, and click the `Connect or Disconnect` button. Repeat until you make a successful connection. Note that your device might have a different name each time you change USB ports. For example, on my computer, the plotting device will be called `cu.usbserial-110` or `cu-usbserial-10` depending on which port I plug it into.  If you can't figure out your device, check out this [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/TravisBumgarner/gcode2dplotterart/discussions/3).

Once you find your device, please share it [here](https://github.com/TravisBumgarner/gcode2dplotterart/discussions/3) to help improve documentation.

### Get your plotting devices's dimensions

These instructions assume you've read the [UGS Features](#ugs-features) section above.

1. Open the Jog Controller. 
2. Select `millimeters` or `inches`. 
3. Move the print head to the most negative X direction (`X-`) and most negative Y direction (`Y-`) it can go. 
4. If you have a 3d printer, attach your drawing instrument to the print head. Move your print head in the negative Z Direction (`Z-`) until your pen is not touching the drawing surface. Note - Your 3D printer might have its Z Axis flipped. You instead might need to move in the positive Z Direction (`Z+`) to move the drawing instrument away from the drawing surface. **Write this number down.**
5. Switch to the Toolbox tab and Click `Reset Zero`. Now we have our starting point for all plotting. 
6. Switch back to the Jog Controller. Move the print head to the most positive X direction (`X+`) and most positive Y direction (`Y+`) it can go. **Write these numbers down.**
7. If you have a 3d printer, you'll need move in the opposite direction you moved in step 3. **Write this number down.**

### Get your plotting devices's feed rate

These instructions assume you've read the [UGS Features](#ugs-features) section above.

1. Attach your drawing instrument to your plotting device. 
2. Open the Jog Controller. 
3. Select `millimeters` or `inches` for units. 
4. Set the `Step size XY` to be about `10` for `millimeters` units and `1` for `inches` units. 
5. Move the print head in the Z direction so that the tip of the drawing instrument is touching the drawing surface. 
6. Select a starting `Feed rate` to experiment with. `5000` is a good starting point for `millimeters` units or `200` for `inches`. 
7. Click on the arrows to move the print head around the drawing surface. 
8. Try raising and lowering the `Feed Rate` until it moves at a speed that works for your device.  **Write this number down.**

### Setting your plotting device to home

An important step when turning on your plotting device is to teach it where the (0,0) (also known as "home" position) is. 

Some devices have limit switches. These are little switches that when pressed down, will instruct the plotting device that it is at 0 in the X-direction or 0 in the Y-direction. TODO - Finish for 3d printers. If your plotting device has limit switches, this step is complete.

If your device does not have limit switches, you'll need to do the following:

1. Open the Jog Controller. 
2. Move the print head to the most negative X direction (`X-`) and most negative Y direction (`Y-`) it can go. 
3. Open Toolbox.
4. Click `Reset to Zero`

Now when you click the `Return to Zero` button, it'll return to this point.

:::danger

Do not click `Return to Zero` if you have not followed the steps above. Your plotting device might run into the walls and make some bad sounding grinding noises.
:::

### Open `.gcode` files

Once you have output from the `gcode2dplotterart` library, they can be opened in UGS. Once opened, you can preview what will be plotted. 

After executing your Python script, you'll receive one or many G-Code files in the `output` directory. In GCS, click the "Open" button in the top left corner to load one of the files.
