# Plotting Tips

## Print on a flat surface

Use a single sheet of flat paper. A notebook might be warped or bent. Tape the sheet of paper to a flat surface. Use the preview layer, generated by setting the `Plotter`'s to outline the print. It'll show if part of the sheet of paper is actually flat. 

## Success when plotting with multiple layers

When attaching a plotting instrument to the plotter head, note its height above the plotting surface. When changing layers and using a new plotting instrument, be sure that the height above the plotting surface is the same as the previous plotting instrument.

## Be mindful of the order in which layers are plotted

This is mostly an artistic decision. Think about how colors layer on top of each other. What is the impact of a lighter color on a darker one, and vice versa?

There is also another consideration to keep in mind. If a darker color is plotted first, then a lighter color on top, the lighter color plotting instrument might absorb some of the dark color and become damaged.
