## Why is my plotting device running into the wall?

Plotting devices can be pretty dumb machines. 

So what's happening? When the plotting device is turned on, it has no memory of where the plotter head previously was. Therefore, it's important, when first turning on the device, to let it know where it is.

The most likely situation is that [reset zero](./ugs#reset-zero) has not been performed.

## UGS says it's connected, but the plotting device is doing nothing.

Click the `Connect or Disconnect` button twice to reestablish a connection with the plotting device.
