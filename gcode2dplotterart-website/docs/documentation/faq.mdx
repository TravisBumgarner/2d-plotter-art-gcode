TODO - Define Me.

## Why is my plotting device running into the wall?

Plotting devices can be pretty dumb machines. 

So what's happening? When you turn on your plotting device, it has no memory of where the print head previously was. Therefore, it's important, when you first turn on your device, to let it know where it is. 

Some plotting devices include limit switches which help prevent your device from running into the wall, others do not. This issue is more prevalent with plotting devices without limit switches.
