# Quick Start - 2D Plotter

TODO - Mention api doc below. 

To get started, you'll need your plotting device's dimensions. If you've never used the Universal G-Code Sender application before, it is recommended you read [this article](./ugs). Or if you prefer, you can jump straight to [Get your plotting device's dimensions](./ugs#get-your-plotting-devicess-dimensions). Once you have your dimensions, you can enter them below. 

```python
from gcode2dplotterart import Plotter

plotter = Plotter(
  units="mm", # Change to `inches` if you're using inches.
  x_min = 0,
  x_max = 100,
  y_min = 0,
  y_max = 100,
  feed_rate=10000, # Depending on your plotting device, you can raise or lower this value.
  output_directory="./output", 
  include_border_layer=False, # Don't draw a border layer
  include_preview_layer=True, # Include a preview layer that'll outline your print without drawing anything.
  handle_out_of_bounds='Warning' # If a plotted point is outside of the bounds, give a warning, don't plot the point, and keep going.
)
```

You can add several layers to plot with different colors, for now we'll stick with one layer.
```
LAYER_1 = 'layer_1'
plotter.add_layer(LAYER_1)
```

Draw a rectangle that starts at (25,25) and ends at (50,50). First you'll select the layer you want to draw on, in this case we only have one layer so we go with `LAYER_1`. Then we add a rectangle that consists of two points, the start (x,y) and the end (x,y).
```
plotter.layers[LAYER_1].add_rectangle(x_start=25, y_start=25, x_end=50, y_end=50)
```

Other methods include `add_line`, `add_path`, `add_circle`, and `add_point`.  

Now save the layers.

```
plotter.save()
```

If you navigate to the folder specified by `output_directory`, you should now see two files `preview.gcode` and `layer_1.gcode`. If you like, you can open each of the files and browse the code. The [G-Code Overview](./gcode) includes explanations of all of the instructions.

For a full description of the API, check out the [Plotter API](./api/plotter) and the [Layer API](./api/layer).


TODO - Set the origin if needed

Start plotting. Don't forget to return to zero.
TODO - Can I improve the return to zero for folks without limit siwtches?
