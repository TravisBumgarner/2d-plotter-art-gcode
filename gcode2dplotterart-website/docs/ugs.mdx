# Universal G-Code Sender (UGS)

## What is UGS?

UGS is the go to software for interacting with your plotting device. It offers a bunch of helpful tools to get started and can be used to send G-Code instructions and G-Code files to your device. 

## Installation

Navigate to the [https://winder.github.io/ugs_website/download/](UGS) download page to get the software for your operating system. 

## Setup

Once the software is opened, plug in your plotting device to your computer. Click the `Connect or Disconnect` button in the top left corner. Your device should now be connected. If this step does not work, visit the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/TravisBumgarner/gcode2dplotterart/discussions) page. You will need a GitHub account to start or reply to a discussion.

## Useful Features
