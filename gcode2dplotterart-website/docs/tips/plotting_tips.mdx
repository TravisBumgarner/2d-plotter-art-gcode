# Plotting Tips

## Print on a flat surface

I like to put all my of my prints into a notebook. However, over time, my notebook starts to get warped a little bit and was not flat. Therefore, I now use single sheets of paper I can tell are flat.


## Mount your drawing surface

The plotting device tends to drag a bit when drawing. Which if you're using a lightweight drawing surface like a piece of paper, it'll move around. Use some tape or little weights to stop the paper from moving. If you use weights, make sure they don't get in the way of your plotting device's movements.

## Multi layer success

If you are plotting with multiple drawing instruments, it's important to make sure they're all the same height above the drawing surface. This is especially important if your plotting device holds the plotting instrument at an angle. If you don't set every drawing instrument to the same height, it'll make contact with the drawing surface at different x,y locations. To do this, attach one of your drawing instruments, such as a marker, to the plotting device. Measure the distance from the point of the marker to where it's attached. Remove the marker and wrap a little bit of tape around the marker. Repeat this process for your other drawing instruments. Now, when you attach a drawing instrument to your plotting device, you'll have a point of reference for where to attach it. 
lotted point is where you expect it to be. 

## Be mindful of the order in which you plot layers

This is mostly an artistic decision. Think about how colors layer on top of each other. What is the impact of a lighter color on a darker one, and vice versa?

There is also another consideration to keep in mind. If you plot a darker color first, then a lighter color on top, the lighter color drawing instrument might absorb some of the color and become damaged.
