# Quick start

This guide covers setup for both 2D plotter and 3D printers. Instructions at certain steps will differ based on if you are using a 2D plotter or 3D printer. Additionally, 3D printers require some extra setup steps and will be noted with an additional section of **3D printer**. 

## 1. Library Installation

Install the Python package with `pip install gcode2dplotterart`


## 2. Setup Hardware

### 3D Printer

Follow the guide to [Convert your 3D Printer to a 2D Plotter](./guides/convert-3d-to-2d).

## 3. Get Plotting Device Dimensions

You will need your plotting device's dimensions. If you've never used the Universal G-Code Sender application before, it is recommended you read [this article](./guides/ugs). Or if you prefer, you can jump straight to [Get your plotting device's dimensions](./guides/ugs#get-your-plotting-devicess-dimensions). Once you have your dimensions, you can enter them below. Be sure

:::note

Be sure to import the correct class, `Plotter2d`, or `Plotter3d` depending on the device you're using.

:::

### 2D Plotter

```python
from gcode2dplotterart import Plotter2d

plotter = Plotter2d(
  units="mm", # Change to `inches` if you're using inches.
  x_min = 0,
  x_max = 0,
  y_min = 0,
  y_max = 0,
  feed_rate=10000, # Depending on your plotting device, you can raise or lower this value.
  output_directory="./output", 
  include_border_layer=False, # Don't draw a border layer
  include_preview_layer=True, # Include a preview layer that'll outline your print without drawing anything.
  handle_out_of_bounds='Warning' # If a plotted point is outside of the bounds, give a warning, don't plot the point, and keep going.
)
```

### 3D Printer

```python
from gcode2dplotterart import Plotter3d

plotter = Plotter3d(
  units="mm", # Change to `inches` if you're using inches.
  x_min = 0,
  x_max = 0,
  y_min = 0,
  y_max = 0,
  z_drawing_height = 0,
  z_navigation_height = 0,
  feed_rate=10000, # Depending on your plotting device, you can raise or lower this value.
  output_directory="./output", 
  include_border_layer=False, # Don't draw a border layer
  include_preview_layer=True, # Include a preview layer that'll outline your print without drawing anything.
  handle_out_of_bounds='Warning' # If a plotted point is outside of the bounds, give a warning, don't plot the point, and keep going.
)
```

## 4. Add a layer

A layer is a group of instructions that will be executed sequentially.  It usually makes sense to create layers based on the drawing instruments being used. 

You can add several layers to plot with different colors, for now we'll stick with one layer.
```

layer_1 = 'black_marker_layer'
Layer_2 = 'blue_pen_layer'

plotter.add_layer(Layer_1)
plotter.add_layer(Layer_2)
```

## 5. Add lines, shapes, and paths to the layers

Once a layer is created, start appending instructions to that layer.


```
plotter.layers[Layer_1].add_rectangle(x_start=25, y_start=25, x_end=50, y_end=50)
plotter.layers[Layer_1].add_point(30, 40)
plotter.layers[Layer_2].add_circle(1, 1, 10)
plotter.layers[Layer_2].add_rectangle(50, 50, 75, 75)
plotter.layers[Layer_1].add_path([(10, 10), (20, 20), (30, 30)]).add_line(0, 15, 0, 15
```
 

## 6. Save layers to file

```
plotter.save()
```

If you navigate to the folder specified by `output_directory`, you should now see three files `preview.gcode`, `Layer_1.gcode`, and `Layer_2.gcode`. If you like, you can open each of the files and browse the code. The [G-Code Overview](./guides/gcode) includes explanations of all of the instructions.

For a full description of the API, check out the [Plotter API](./api/plotter) and the [Layer API](./api/layer).

## 7. Plot

TODO - Set the origin if needed

Start plotting. Don't forget to return to zero.
TODO - Can I improve the return to zero for folks without limit siwtches?
