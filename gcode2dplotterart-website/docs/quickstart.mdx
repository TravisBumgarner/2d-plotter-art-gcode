# Quick start

This guide covers setup for both 2D plotter and 3D printers. Instructions at certain steps will differ based on if a 2D plotter or 3D printer is being used. Additionally, specifiic devices will require some extra setup steps and will be noted with an additional section of **2D plotter** or **3D printer**.

## 0. Reference the Terminology

It is useful to keep the [terminology help doc](./documentation/terminology) open while reading through the quick start. 

## 1. Install dependencies

Install the Python package with `pip install gcode2dplotterart` and the [Universal G-Code Sender](./documentation/ugs#installation) software.

## 2. Setup Hardware

### 2D plotter

No special setup required. 

### 3D printer

Follow the guide to [Convert a 3D printer to a 2D plotter](./documentation/convert-3d-to-2d).

## 3. Learn about UGS

If the Universal G-Code Sender application has never been used before, it is recommended to read [this article](./documentation/ugs).

## 4. Get Plotting Device Dimensions and Feed Rate

The [plotting device](./documentation/terminology#plotting-device)'s dimensions act as a constraint to make sure anything that is plotted in code will physically fit within the bounds of the plotting device. [Get the plotting device's dimensions](./documentation/ugs#get-the-plotting-devicess-dimensions). 

The feed rate is a measure of how quickly the [plotter head](./documentation/terminology#plotter-head) can move. It's good to tweak this so that the plotting device moves not too fast that it'll create imperfections and not too slow that plotting takes forever. [Get the plotting device's feed rate](./documentation/ugs#get-the-plotting-devicess-feed-rate).

Fill in the plotting device's dimensions and feed rate below. 

### 2D plotter

```python
from gcode2dplotterart import Plotter2D

plotter=Plotter2D(
  title="Plotter2D Quickstart",
  
  # The following 4 values are from the `Get the plotting device's dimensions` article above. 
  x_min=0, # This will be the value `X-` or 0
  x_max=200, # This will be the value `X+`
  y_min=0, # This will be the value `Y-` or 0
  y_max=200, # This will be the value `Y+` or 0
  
  # This value is from the `Get the plotting device's feed rate` article above.
  feed_rate=0,

  output_directory="./output", 
  handle_out_of_bounds='Warning' # If a plotted point is outside of the bounds, give a warning, don't plot the point, and keep going.
)
```

### 3D printer

```python
from gcode2dplotterart import Plotter3D

plotter=Plotter3D(
  title="Plotter3D Quickstart",
  
  # The following 6 values are from the `Get the plotting device's dimensions` article above. 
  x_min=0, # This will be the value `X-` or 0
  x_max=200, # This will be the value `X+`
  y_min=0, # This will be the value `Y-` or 0
  y_max=200, # This will be the value `Y+` or 0
  z_plotting_height=0, # This will be the value of `Z` that connects the plotter head to the plotting surface.
  z_navigation_height=0, # This will be the value of `Z` that separate the plotter head from the plotting surface.

  # This value is from the `Get the plotting device's feed rate` article above.
  feed_rate=0,

  output_directory="./output", 
  handle_out_of_bounds='Warning' # If a plotted point is outside of the bounds, give a warning, don't plot the point, and keep going.
)
```

## 5. Add a layer

A layer is a group of [instructions](./documentation/terminology#instruction) that will be executed sequentially.  It usually makes sense to create layers based on the [plotting instruments](./documentation/terminology#plotting-instrument) being used. 

Several layers can be added to plot with different colors. The `color` value is used to generate a preview before plotting. A hex color (such as `#00FF00`) or human readable color name (see [MatplotLib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html#css-colors) for list of supported color names) can be used. 

```python
black_pen_layer = "black_pen_layer"
blue_marker_layer = "blue_marker_layer"
green_marker_layer = "green_marker_layer"

plotter.add_layer(black_pen_layer, color="black", line_width=1.0)
plotter.add_layer(blue_marker_layer, color="blue", line_width=4.0)
plotter.add_layer(green_marker_layer, color="#027F00", line_width=4.0)
```

## 6. Add lines, shapes, and paths to the layers

Once a layer is created, start appending instructions to that layer. Note that the points should fit inside the plotting device's bounds, or else warnings will be seen when executing the script

```python
plotter.layers[black_pen_layer].add_point(x=30, y=40)
plotter.layers[blue_marker_layer].add_circle(x_center=10, y_center=30, radius=10)
plotter.layers[blue_marker_layer].add_rectangle(x_start=50, y_start=50, x_end=75, y_end=75)
plotter.layers[green_marker_layer].add_path([(10, 10), (20, 25), (30, 15), (1, 100)])
plotter.layers[green_marker_layer].add_line(x_start=70, y_start=80, x_end=70, y_end=15)
```
 
## 7. Generate a preview

```python
plotter.preview()
```

This will open up a preview of what will be plotted. This can be useful to spot check the G-Code instructions before plotting begins.

## 8. Save layers to file

```python
plotter.save()
```

Inside the folder specified by the plotter's `output_directory` and `title` there will be four files `preview.gcode`, `blue_marker_layer.gcode`, `black_pen_layer.gcode`, and `green_marker_layer.gcode`. Each of the files can be opened and the code browsed. The [G-Code Overview](./documentation/gcode) includes explanations of all of the instructions used in this library.

For a full description of the API, check out the [Plotter API](./api/plotter) and the [Layer API](./api/layer).

## 7. Plot

Be sure to [Reset Zero](documentation/ugs#reset-zero) every time the plotting device is powered on.
