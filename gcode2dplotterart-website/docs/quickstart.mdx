# Quick start

This guide covers setup for both 2D plotter and 3D printers. Instructions at certain steps will differ based on if you are using a 2D plotter or 3D printer. Additionally, 3D printers require some extra setup steps and will be noted with an additional section of **3D printer**. 

## 0. Reference the Terminology

It is useful to keep the [terminology help doc](./documentation/terminology) open while reading through the quick start. 

## 1. Install Library

Install the Python package with `pip install gcode2dplotterart`

## 2. Setup Hardware

### 2D Plotter

No special setup required. 

### 3D Printer

Follow the guide to [Convert your 3D Printer to a 2D Plotter](./documentation/convert-3d-to-2d).

## 3. Learn about UGS

If you've never used the Universal G-Code Sender application before, it is recommended you read [this article](./documentation/ugs).

## 4. Get Plotting Device Dimensions

[Get your plotting device's dimensions](./documentation/ugs#get-your-plotting-devicess-dimensions).

[Get your plotting device's feed rate](./documentation/ugs#get-your-plotting-devicess-feed-rate).

Fill in the plotting device's dimensions and feed rate below. 

### 2D Plotter

```python
from gcode2dplotterart import Plotter2d

plotter=Plotter2d(
  units="mm", # Change to `inches` if you're using inches.
  x_min=0,
  x_max=0,
  y_min=0,
  y_max=0,
  feed_rate=0,
  output_directory="./output", 
  include_border_layer=False, # Don't draw a border layer
  include_preview_layer=True, # Include a preview layer that'll outline your print without drawing anything.
  handle_out_of_bounds='Warning' # If a plotted point is outside of the bounds, give a warning, don't plot the point, and keep going.
)
```

### 3D Printer

```python
from gcode2dplotterart import Plotter3d

plotter=Plotter3d(
  units="mm", # Change to `inches` if you're using inches.
  x_min=0,
  x_max=0,
  y_min=0,
  y_max=0,
  z_drawing_height=0,
  z_navigation_height=0,
  feed_rate=0,
  output_directory="./output", 
  include_border_layer=False, # Don't draw a border layer
  include_preview_layer=True, # Include a preview layer that'll outline your print without drawing anything.
  handle_out_of_bounds='Warning' # If a plotted point is outside of the bounds, give a warning, don't plot the point, and keep going.
)
```

## 5. Add a layer

A layer is a group of instructions that will be executed sequentially.  It usually makes sense to create layers based on the drawing instruments being used. 

You can add several layers to plot with different colors. The `color` value is used to generate a preview before plotting. A hex color (such as `#00FF00`) or human readable color name (see [MatplotLib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html#css-colors) for list of supported color names) can be used. 

```

layer_1='black_marker_layer'
Layer_2='blue_pen_layer'

plotter.add_layer(Layer_1, color="blue")
plotter.add_layer(Layer_2, color="black")
```

## 6. Add lines, shapes, and paths to the layers

Once a layer is created, start appending instructions to that layer.


```
plotter.layers[Layer_1].add_rectangle(x_start=25, y_start=25, x_end=50, y_end=50)
plotter.layers[Layer_1].add_point(30, 40)
plotter.layers[Layer_2].add_circle(1, 1, 10)
plotter.layers[Layer_2].add_rectangle(50, 50, 75, 75)
plotter.layers[Layer_1].add_path([(10, 10), (20, 20), (30, 30)]).add_line(0, 15, 0, 15
```
 
## 7. Generate a preview

```
plotter.preview()
```

This will open up a preview of what will be plotted.

## 8. Save layers to file

```
plotter.save()
```

If you navigate to the folder specified by `output_directory`, you should now see three files `preview.gcode`, `Layer_1.gcode`, and `Layer_2.gcode`. If you like, you can open each of the files and browse the code. The [G-Code Overview](./documentation/gcode) includes explanations of all of the instructions.

For a full description of the API, check out the [Plotter API](./api/plotter) and the [Layer API](./api/layer).

## 7. Plot

TODO - Set the origin if needed

Start plotting. Don't forget to return to zero.
TODO - Can I improve the return to zero for folks without limit siwtches?
